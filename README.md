# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sascha-nabrotzky
I taught myself to program in JavaScript and afterwards created some webapps / websites with the help of React, some of which I will continue to maintain. I also got to know **HTML5, SCSS, React Router, Helmet, Gatsby, GraphQL** - but there is still a lot to learn. To really get to the heart of websites, I took courses in **UI / UX design.**
Before that I programmed websites purely in HTML/CSS3 and Joomla! came into use. No matter what I do, I always end up in the source code.

### I love to .fetch data to the page from anywhere without losing sight of the design.
